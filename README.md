# The-main-idea-for-dogecoin
How it should be laid out fundamentally.....how it will succeed as the only form of crypto currency the world will need


Imagine going to multiple foreign countries....you took Elon Musks space shuttle transportation system and you continue to use it so you can go anywhere you want in almost no time at all.

Now imagine having to transfer your money into each countries currency.....that would take a long time. You're traveling fast and vacationing fast, why let that part of the process be slow?

Having only one worldwide currency can fix that. We could go to any country we want and as many as we want and we could completely avoid that. We could just get off the shuttle and go buy whatever.

If we have several forms of cryptocurrency, it can get complicated. What if we don't have the kind that's being accepted? It's more efficient if we only have one ultimate form that works for everyone everywhere.

Can dogecoin be this currency? Idk, I have no idea what dogecoin really is.


But


What I do know is this, no matter what dogecoin is, if it decides to become that one form of currency it can by simply making the changes that need to be made.

We really only need one Walmart and on Amazon.....competition there would make things complicated as well. Monopolies are bad where there is greed but where there

Is complete honesty, monopolies are the best thing that can happen in an industry. The more people working together, the better....monopolies in this fashion would mean

That nobody is trying to beat anybody, they're simply ALL doing he most they can as each individual to make the company grow and to help the world become more abundant

And getting paid fairly every single time. 


So if dogecoin functioned that same way.....the same way I recognize PayPal, they would become the only form of currency. It would connect the entire world in a new way. If we ALL focused on dogecoin instead of multiple
 
other currencies, we're heading towards that destiny much quicker and the world will advance much quicker. Just make sure everyone is paid fairly and there won't be 

Any problems.

So will dogecoin become the one and only? Or, is someone else going to do it?




Choose to be that currency, dogecoin.

Give the world a form of currency that any country can use.
